# BuzzardsBay 0.1.0.9004

* Add `bb_options()` for setting and retrieving global parameters which are
  stored in a private environment, `bbp`.
* Move auto qc parameters from `[qc_deployment()] and helper functions into
  global parameters.
* Add `tide_station_info` dataset containing locations of NOAA tide stations 
  in Buzzard's bay.
* Add `inst/rmd/QAQC_report.rmd` with plots and summary information to
  facilitate quality control and quality assurance.
* Add `make_deployment_report()` to make QAQC report from data in a deployment
  directory.
* `qc_deployment()` now makes the report automatically unless the new `report`
  argument is set to `FALSE`.

* Update example dataset. In prior example data the Conductivity didn't match
  in the DO and Cond. data and it should.
* Update Details.txt processing to work with newer data that has different 
  line endings.  It now works with any combination of CR and LF line endings.
* Add test for consistent conductivity and dropped duplicate conductivity 
  column.
* Add test for consistent calibration start and end time in the two details
  files and consolidated the start and end times in the metadata file.
* Drop <data>_flag  columns.   "Flags" covers all flags.
* Adopt standard "year-month-day" date, and "year-month-day h:m:s"
  date time formats everywhere.
* Add more checks for consistency against sites table and placements table.
  * Logger SN's must be in placement table at the site indicated by the 
    deployment path.
  * Deployment date from path must match date of last observation in data.
* Add range checks against sites table for DO, both Temperature Columns,
  DO Pct. Saturation, and 
* Add DO ratios to metadata - this is the 
      "meter/titration value (mg/L)" divided by the "DO conc"
       from the DO details.txt file created by HOBOware for both the 
       start and end calibrations
* Add `sites.csv` and `placements.csv` to example data and to files created
  by `setup_example_data()` 
* Cut off the pre and post calibration observations from the head and tail of 
   the file. 
* Add  "pct_calibrated", "n_records", "pct_immediate_rejection", and
  "pct_flagged_for_review" to metadata.
* Add warning if "pct_calibrated" is less than 95.


# BuzzardsBay 0.1.0.9002

* Add `README.Rmd` and `NEWS.md` files.
* Update temperature flags so they indicate which dataset they are associated 
with.
