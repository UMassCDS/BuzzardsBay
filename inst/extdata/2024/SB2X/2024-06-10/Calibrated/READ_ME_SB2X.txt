SB2X Ð 2024-06-10Calibration was performed using one point calibration with the first datapoint only. Using endpoint calibration inflated salinity in the middle of the time series. Near the end of the series, the data begins to drift downward, likely due to fouling of the sensor (it was in for 3-4 weeks without servicing) and conductivity data during that shift may need to be rejected during QA/QC. Calibration for DO sensors was done using data from one-point CT calibration. Adjusted DO data does not contain the same downward trajectory. Temperature data between both sensors remains mostly consistent. Ð KH 6/11/24
