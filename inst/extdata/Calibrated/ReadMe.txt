Lara Gulmann emailed these files to me on 2024-04-17. They are example calibrated Dissolved Oxygen and Conductance/Salinity as output from HOBOware.

I changed the names to conform with the proposed naming scheme:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kJttcEXzpNNknGwjkVwdYHw9LzZyjJ-FaX0CrU7H7NU

Original Names:
SR4_AdjDO_06_21_22_lkg.csv
SR4_AdjDO_06_21_22_lkg_Details.txt
SR4_SpecCon_06_21_22_lkg.csv
SR4_SpecCon_06_21_22_lkg_Details.txt

To:
DO_20659181_2022-07-08_cal.csv
DO_20659181_2022-07-08_cal_Details.txt
Sal_20649629_2022-07-08_cal.csv
Sal_20649629_2022-07-08_cal_Details.txt

The original data appears to be the middle of the deployment window.

When used as example data it should have a path:
	BB_Data\2022\SR4\2022-07-08\Calibrated\
But tarballs don't allow long paths so I can't use the whole relative path in
inst/.
