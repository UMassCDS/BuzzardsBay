# BuzzardsBay

The goal of **BuzzardsBay** (R package) is to process and analyze data
for the [Continuous Oxygen Monitoring in Buzzards Bay (COMBB)
project](https://www.woodwellclimate.org/project/combb/).

This package is split into two modules, the **QC Module**, which
prepares calibrated data and produces a report in preparation for a
quality control editing of deployment files, and the **Analysis
Module**, which stitches deployment files for a site and year into a set
of result files, produces a daily statistical summary file, and a report
with seasonal statistics and a set of graphs.

## Installation

You can install or update **BuzzardsBay** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UMassCDS/BuzzardsBay")
```

To make seasonal reports, you’ll also need to install TinyTeX, which is
required to create PDFs. Use:

``` R
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

## QC Module

The primary function in the QC module is
[`qc_deployment()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/qc_deployment.md)
it reads in calibrated data for a deployment and generates files
containing merged and flagged copies of the data, and an html report
with plots of the data.  
A second function
[`make_deployment_report()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/make_deployment_report.md)
is typically called by
[`qc_deployment()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/qc_deployment.md)
but can also be called independently to recreate the report from CSV
files created by
[`qc_deployment()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/qc_deployment.md).

### File structure

[`qc_deployment()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/qc_deployment.md)
and the **BuzzardsBay** package in general assume [a specific file
structure and naming
convention](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kJttcEXzpNNknGwjkVwdYHw9LzZyjJ-FaX0CrU7H7NU).

In particular:

- All the data associated with a deployment should be stored in a
  deployment directory with a path
  `/BB_Data/<year>/<site>/<year>-<month>-<day>/` e.g.  
  `"~/BB_Data/2022/SR4/2022-07-08"`.  
- The path to base directory and it’s name (`"BB_Data"` in example) can
  be any valid path.
- Within the deployment directory there should be a “Calibrated/”
  sub-directory with the calibrated files in one of the three supported
  formats:
  - Simple import based on a CSV and a YAML file.
  - HOBOware output with a `.csv` and `details.txt` file for both the
    conductivity and DO logger.  
    Likely from `U24` and `U26` loggers.
  - A single `.xlsx` file as generate with the `MX801` logger.

See help for
[`import_calibrated_data()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/import_calibrated_data.md)
for a detailed description of these files.

### Usage

Once files are in place we can process the calibrated data in the
deployment and generate the html report with the code below.

``` r
library(BuzzardsBay)
deployment_dir <- ""  # Provide full path here. Don't include `Calibration/`
qc_deployment(deployment_dir)
```

### Running on example data

Create an example data folder structure and deployment with
[`setup_example_dir()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/setup_example_dir.md).
If you specify a path with the `parent_dir` argument the example will be
created there. Otherwise, as in the example below, it creates the
example files within the location specified by
[`tempdir()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/tempfile.html).

``` r
paths <- setup_example_dir()  
print(paths)
```

With that in place we can then call
[`qc_deployment()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/qc_deployment.md)
on the example deployment stored in `paths$deployment` which will also
be where the output files are created.

``` r
a <- qc_deployment(paths$deployment)
```

The code above will only work once as
[`qc_deployment()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/qc_deployment.md)
will throw an error if the output already exists. To run again create a
fresh example directory with: `setup_example_dir(delete_old = TRUE)`

#### Output

[`qc_deployment()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/qc_deployment.md)
writes two identical CSV files, a metadata file, and an HTML report to
the deployment directory.

- `Auto_QC_<deployment>.csv` is a permanent record of this state of the
  process and should not be edited.
- `Preliminary_QC_<deployment>.csv` is for subsequent review and
  editing. `Preliminary_` should be dropped from the name when review is
  complete.
- `Metadata_<deployment>.yml` contains the metadata written as a YAML
  file.
- `QC_<deployment>_report.html` contains plots and summary information
  about the deployment. It is a very large file so should be deleted
  after the QC is complete. It can be recreated later with
  `make_deployment_report(deployment_dir)` as long as the Auto QC and
  metadata files are present.

## Analysis Module

The Analysis Module consists of three primary functions:
[`stitch_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/stitch_site.md),
[`check_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/check_site.md),
and
[`report_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/report_site.md).
Each takes the site path as the primary argument,
`/BB_Data/<year>/<site>` e.g. `"~/BB_Data/2022/AB2"`. An additional
function,
[`extract_baywatchers()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/extract_baywatchers.md),
applies to all sites for a given year.

1.  [`stitch_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/stitch_site.md)
    reads the deployment files for the specified site and year and
    merges them into a single file. Gaps between deployments are filled
    with missing values (a warning is displayed if the gap is greater
    than 1 hour; this may be changed with the `max_gap` option, setting
    the maximum gap (in hours) to accept silently. Three result files
    are written to `/BB_Data/<year>/<site>/<combined>/`:

    1.  The **archive** file, e.g., `archive_AB2_2024.csv`, with all
        columns and values, including rejected data. Missing data are
        represented by blanks. This file is intended to be for long-term
        storage of the complete set of QC’d data.

    2.  The **WPP** file, e.g., `WPP_AB2_2024.csv`, with all columns.
        Rejected values are replaced with `DR` (for “data rejected”).
        Missing data are represented by blanks. This file is in the
        format that MassDEP wants.

    3.  The **core** file, e.g., `core_AB2_2024.csv`, with selected
        columns. Rejected values and missing values are represented by
        blanks. This is the file used for statistics and graphs in the
        report, and is also intended for sharing with collaborators.

    [`stitch_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/stitch_site.md)
    can optionally run
    [`report_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/report_site.md)
    (use `report = TRUE`) to stitch and produce a report for the site in
    one call.

2.  `extract_baywatchers` extracts a given year’s Baywatchers data from
    the Excel repository, which must be placed in the base directory
    (`BB_data`).

3.  [`check_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/check_site.md),
    intended to be run after some time has elapsed since running
    [`stitch_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/stitch_site.md),
    checks to see if any of the deployment files have been updated or if
    any of the result data files have changed (likely through
    inadvertent editing). It also checks for missing files. If a site
    passes
    [`check_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/check_site.md),
    the result data files are up to date. If it fails, result files and
    the report need to be recreated by running
    [`stitch_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/stitch_site.md)
    again. `check_site` also checks to make sure data haven’t been
    changed since most recent report has been produced, and it checks to
    be sure that extracted Baywatchers data are up to date with respect
    to the source Excel file.

4.  [`report_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/report_site.md)
    reads the `core` file produced by
    [`stitch_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/stitch_site.md)
    and produces the daily statistics file, e.g.,
    `combined\daily_stats_AB2_2024.csv`, the seasonally summary
    statistics file, e.g., `combined\seasonal_stats_AB2_2024.csv`, and
    the site report, `combined\site_report_AB2_2024.pdf`.
    [`report_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/report_site.md)
    normally runs
    [`check_site()`](https://umasscds.github.io/BuzzardsBay/reference/check_site.md)
    before producing the report and throws an error if the check fails;
    you can override this with `check = FALSE`. If you don’t have
    Baywatchers data for this site and year, use `baywatchers = FALSE`.
    The example data for `2023/WH1X` includes Baywatchers data.
